# Layered-Testbench-for-a-Dual-Port-RAM-
Dual-Port RAM is a type of memory that allows simultaneous access to two memory locations through two independent ports. Each port has its own address, data, and control signals, enabling parallel read and write operations without conflicts. This feature makes it highly efficient for systems requiring high-speed data exchange or concurrent processing.

Features of a Dual Port RAM :
1. Simultaneous Access: Allows two independent ports to perform read and write operations concurrently.
2. Independent Control: Each port has separate address, data, and control lines for flexibility.
3. High Speed: Eliminates memory access conflicts, improving data throughput in parallel operations.
4. Versatility: Supports various applications like communication buffers, video processing, and embedded systems.
